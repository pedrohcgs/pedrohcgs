# Hi there👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I am Pedro H. C. Sant'Anna, an Associate Professor at the Department of Economics at Emory University.

I'm an Applied Econometrician, and I am very curious about how econometric things work (in theory and in practice).

My main areas of research interest are in the intersection of
- **Causal Inference**;
- **Data-adaptive methods** (aka Machine Learning);
- **Semiparametric methods**;
- **Applied Microeconomics**.


In the last few years, I have devoted much of my time to developing, better understanding, and improving **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** methods.

I have also spent some time in Tech (Microsoft and Amazon), which I've greatly enjoyed.


In my GitHub, you will find: 
- 📦  Packages that I have developed with co-authors (usually in R);
- 💾  Replication packages for some of my published papers;
- 📝  Some lecture notes from courses that I teach.
